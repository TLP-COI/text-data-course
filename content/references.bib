  abstract        = {Abstract Despite recent dramatic successes, natural
                  language processing (NLP) is not ready to address a variety of
                  real-world problems. Its reliance on large standard corpora, a
                  training and evaluation paradigm that favors the learning of
                  shallow heuristics, and large computational resource
                  requirements, makes domain-specific application of even the
                  most successful NLP techniques difficult. This paper proposes
                  technical language processing (TLP) which brings engineering
                  principles and practices to NLP specifically for the purpose
                  of extracting actionable information from language generated
                  by experts in their technical tasks, systems, and processes.
                  TLP envisages NLP as a socio-technical system rather than as
                  an algorithmic pipeline. We describe how the TLP approach to
                  meaning and generalization differs from that of NLP, how data
                  quantity and quality can be addressed in engineering technical
                  domains, and the potential risks of not adapting NLP for
                  technical use cases. Engineering problems can benefit
                  immensely from the inclusion of knowledge from unstructured
                  data, currently unavailable due to issues with out of the box
                  NLP packages. We illustrate the TLP approach by focusing on
                  maintenance in industrial organizations as a case-study.},
