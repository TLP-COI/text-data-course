This syllabus is a draft, and subject to change. 
Use it as a guide for course expectations, but always clarify with a question if something seems uncertain!

## Prerequisites

- Comfortable with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. Other languages are acceptable for submission of work (e.g. R, Julia, Octave), especially if the language has a working kernel interface to Jupyter Notebooks, but the course examples and software overviews will be demonstrated exclusively in Python. 
  Experience using the foundational data science tools in Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) will be immensely helpful. 
- Comfort using version control systems (git), and plain-text markup for project and homework tracking and submission. 
- Familiar with basic statistics concepts (discrete and continuous distributions, Bayes' rule, sampling, etc.); Some exposure to machine learning concepts (classification, clustering, regression, supervised vs un/semi-supervised learning). 
- Those unfamiliar with one or more of the above are welcome to take the course! Links to resources might be available, but responsibility for catching up will rest with *you*, and all students will be held to the same standard of work. 

## Course Schedule

The Sections are broken down slightly different from most NLP or text analysis courses. 
By using problem-solving frameworks from e.g. engineering disciplines, I hope to bring a flavor of just how _important_ context is to your applications of these technicques to technical text. 

```{margin}
Bring a laptop every week, as the section material will be largely interactive and easy to follow along with, yourself.
```

- Week 1: Introduction and Logistics 
- Week 4-5: Unit 1 --- Assumptions (to "P" the "NL")
- Week 2-3: Unit 2 --- Goals & Approaches in Text Analyses
- Week 6-7: Unit 3 --- Measuring & Evaluating NLP "Systems"
- Week 8-9: Unit 4 --- Validation (and the role of expertise)
- Week 10-12: Case Studies, Special topics, & Guest Lectures
- Week 13-14: Project Discussions, Q&A, and Final Presentations


## Evaluation

Participation - 20%
: Participate in class discussions, analysing the impacts and nuance of various techniques and datasets we use or read about. 
  Much of the lecture is intented to operate similar to a lab, getting hands-on experience using the data, tools, and techniques described. 

Homework - 30%
: Apply concepts to your own data each of the four content-sections. 
  A lot of the this course will center around not only applying NLP and other analysis types, but interpreting and critically engaging with assumptions, flaws, and possibilities they present in the context of your domain. 
  Always report on your thoughts and methods, think outside-the-box, and get help ahead-of-time if you're feeling stuck. 

Project - 50%
: One project, likely broken into two staged "submissions" (20% each) during the semester, and a final presentation to the class (10%).
  Intended to allow free-form exploration and decision support using your dataset of choice, to emulate the ways NLP gets applied in technical domains. 

Extra Credit - 5%
: There will be extra credit available for those that are willing/able to create interactive presentations or visualizations from their homeworks. 
  These must be presented to the class at the beginning of the lecture, and used to guide a short (15-min) class discussion about homework experiences and observations. 
  Email or talk with me about your planned presentation idea *at least 48 hours prior* to the start of class so I can provide feedback or direction. 

 ```{margin}
 In other words, an on-time submission graded 90% will be worth 81% the next day, and 73% the day after that. 
```
  
 Late work will be accepted, at a cost of 10% the remaining point value per day.
