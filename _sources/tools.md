# Tools of the Trade

```{note}
WIP
```

Things can get messy, quickly. 

> Programmer vs. Scientist stereotype


## Environment

Opinionated, hopefully sane, defaults

- Python, miniconda/mamba
- jupyter, environments, `nb_conda_kernels`
- project structure, installables


## Dev & Data Operations

- version control (git)
- git forges and branch workflow
- data packages (dvc, frictionless)
- Special: this repository!

## Data Science

- Mostly introduced throughout the course, as needed. 
- Archtypes: pandas, sklearn, nn frameworks
