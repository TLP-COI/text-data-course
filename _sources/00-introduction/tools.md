````

A recurring theme of this course, if there is one: 

> Text analysis is, fundamentally, an _applied_ discipline. 

This means a huge component of actually learning text analysis, NLP, etc., will necessarily focus on hands-on _application_. 
While there is certainly a need and place for deep, theoretical foundations of various algorithms and semantic structure theories... I hope this course will contribute to a holistic view of what _doing_ text analysis involves: from the daily tricks to the dastardly pitfalls. 

_However..._

This focus on application-over-theory means familiarizing yourself with the **tools** that do the application with you. 
So while a lot of time will be invested in discussing tangential tools and contexts, realize that these are all part of building professionalism and unification around what _doing text analysis_ looks like.
