# The Road to TLP

Text Analysis is not just a popular data mining technique; it's not even _just_ a ubiquitous set of assumptions and patterns to assist in _using_ text in computational or statistical ways.
Using text, full of symbolic and semantic meaning --- written and intended _for_ humans to read and understand --- as a source of data? 

That is, arguably, _very cool_. 

Turning text, which seems to be almost certainly _subjective_ at some fundamental level, into something like _objective_ data, whether for decision support, investigations, understanding demographics, or question-answering, can absolutely feel magical. 

However, when tools from domains like Natural Language Processing (NLP) are applied to technical domains (like engineering, medicine, policy, threat assessment, etc.), treating "data" arising from natural-language _text_ as "magic" will fundamentally contradict the purpose of those evidence-based fields.

>Its reliance on large standard corpora, a training and evaluation paradigm that favors the learning of shallow heuristics, and large computational resource requirements, makes domain-specific applica-tion of even the most successful NLP techniques difficult.
